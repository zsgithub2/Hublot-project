<!-- About the project-->
## About the project
Twitter is one of the most used Social Media. A lot of information is disseminated everyday. Lately, one can hardly distinguish real news from fake news. 
This project aims to build Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. 
The project topic relates to a kaggle competition. We have two datasets (train and test) at our disposal to analyse and make the best prediction possible.

<!-- Roadmap -->
## Roadmap
We will start by carrying out a basic EDA to get familiar with the data. We will continue by applying text processing techniques to clean the tweets. We will finish by building different classifiers using different methods such as logistic regression, kNN, Decision trees etc. 
Our objective is to get the best prediction score (accuracy).
